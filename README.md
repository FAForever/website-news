# Newshub for FAForever

This repository contains the source of a proposal for an alternative news hub for [FAForever](https://faforever.com/).

## Technologies

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) ([GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) Tooling to generate the site
  - [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed), Atom/rss feed
  - [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) Features to redirect pages
  - [jekyll-github-metadata](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata), Exposes metadata of GitHub

> The exact version of the Jekyll packages should align with what GitHub expects. This way what you serve locally is more guaranteed to match with what you'll see on GitHub Pages. See also the [GitHub Pages Versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) page.
