[Visual Studio Code]() is an integrated development environment or IDE for short. It is a text editor empowered with various tooling to make it easier to make, compile and test software. The news website is software. It uses [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and Ruby to compile and run the website in a browser.

This article is full of links. You do not need to review all of them. They exist in case you want to learn more.

There are various great (video) tutorials on the internet that can introduce you to Visual Studio Code. I'll reference some that I think can be meaningful. For this article we only focus on what we need to communicate to you where to click. See also the following image:

# Extensions

Open the `Extensions` in the Activity Bar. The strength of Visual Studio Code is in its extensions. In general be ware of installing extensions. Extensions run code on your device. This can be to improve your development experience or to do [something with usernames and passwords](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vscode-extensions-with-9-million-installs-pulled-over-security-risks/).

With that said, I recommend the following extensions:

- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker): Introduces a basic spell checker.
- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): Improves the support of Git.
- [Liquid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sissel.shopify-liquid): Improves the support of files with Liquid in it, which is common for Jekyll projects.
- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one): Improves the support of Markdown files.
