CDRMV’s Commander Survival Kit mod just got updated. It’s a co-op and survival oriented mod that allows calling in backup, airstrikes and much, much more. Due to limitations to file sizes, it can not be found in the Mod Vault, so make sure to check out the details on how to get it and how it works in the linked forum post!
