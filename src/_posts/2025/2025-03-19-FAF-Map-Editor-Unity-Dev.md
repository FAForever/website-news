The official map editor can use a maintainer or two! There's various features that would be of immense value to map authors. At the moment BlackYps is working to implement the advanced terrain shaders in the editor. If you have experience with C# and/or with Unity and you're interested in helping out then reach out to BlackYps on Discord.
