Contributors are the backbone of FAForever. One goal of last year was to map out all the different area's where people contribute. With thanks to Magge this is now also available as a forum post!

Relevant resources to start contributing can be a little bit scattered. You can always ask in Discord. Here's some additional references:

- [Statutes of the teams](https://wiki.faforever.com/en/Infrastructure/FAF-Teams)
- [Looking for Volunteers channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/197033481883222026/1168179121843613760)

For developers, we have:

- [FAForever organization on GitHub](https://github.com/FAForever)
- [Zulip of FAForever](https://faforever.zulipchat.com/)

Note that you need to be given access to Zulip. This is to reduce clutter. You can ask a moderator to get access.
